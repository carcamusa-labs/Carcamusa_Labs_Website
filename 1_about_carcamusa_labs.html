              <h2>[ ABOUT ]</h2>
              <p class="indented_p"> Hi, I‚Äôm Martin Rosa, the one-dude behind Carcamusa_Labs.</p>
              <p class="indented_p"> I‚Äôm a QA Engineer ‚Äì both manual and automation, with a deep love for programming and the development of all sorts of stuff, seeking to become a full-time Web developer. Whether it‚Äôs websites or videogames, I‚Äôm all in. Oh, and I‚Äôm also a (really bad) design enthusiast, and synthetizer-musician-wannabe, just to throw that in there.</p>
              <p class="indented_p"> Carcamusa_Labs started as a project, but it quickly became my personal (and hopefully professional enough) webpage where I could showcase my work, experiences, insights, CV, artwork, and the priceless lessons I've learned from awesome people who kindly took the time to teach me. It‚Äôs a space where I can share what I‚Äôve been working on and what I‚Äôve learned along the way.</p>
              <p class="indented_p"> You‚Äôll find six main sections on this page, each one covering a different area of my journey. Feel free to explore:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><b>1. About Carcamusa_Labs</b> ‚Äì Well, where you are now. More about who I am and why I do what I do.</li>
                <li><b>2. CV & Contact</b> ‚Äì A quick look at my professional experience and how to reach me.</li>
                <li><b>3. Projects</b> ‚Äì A showcase of some of the projects I‚Äôve worked on. They may not be perfect, some of them unfinished maybe, but I really put effort and love into each line I start.</li>
                <li><b>4. Artwork & Other Assets</b> ‚Äì Because I like to dabble in some designs (badly), and some other stuff.</li>
                <li><b>5. Unplugged</b> ‚Äì A section dedicated to a little bit of everything that doesn‚Äôt fit into the other sections, like personal experiences, blog entries, random thoughts, insights, etc.</li>
                <li><b>6. Referrals & Mentors</b> ‚Äì A place to give credit to the people who‚Äôve helped me grow and who I really appreciate, and are sure enough of themselves teaching me, as to recommend my work and skills. Top-professionals them all, you can be sure ;)</li>
              </ul>

              <h2>SOME BACKGROUND AND MY PERSONAL JOURNEY</h2>
              <p class="indented_p">I was born in Uruguay in 1997 and raised in the vibrant city of Montevideo. From a very young age, I was captivated by anything that moved ‚Äì mechanical games, wheels, fans, planes, bikes ‚Äì you name it. At 3 years old, I discovered a Famicom bootleg in my house, and that's when my passion for videogames and all things digital really kicked off.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">Throughout my childhood and adolescence, I was constantly immersed in videogames across a variety of platforms, though I mostly played on emulators since I only had a PC. When I turned 16 and landed my first "formal" job at McDonald's, I started collecting retro consoles I couldn't have as a child, like the NES, SNES, Genesis/Mega Drive, PSOne, PS2, PS3, Saturn, N64, GameCube, Dreamcast, and even handhelds like Gameboy, GB Color, GB Advance, and Game & Watch.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">As a kid, I discovered there were people who made a living testing videogames, and I was immediately fascinated by the idea. However, I knew that in Uruguay, where the market was small, it would be difficult to pursue a career in that field. Still, it remained a dream in the back of my mind.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">During high school, I studied Electromechanical Engineering and graduated with a Bachelor's degree, although I never really put that education to use. At 18-19, I started working as a cook, with the intention of moving to New Zealand to work in hotels and restaurants as a cook or bartender. But after realizing that it wasn't my path, I decided to take a more serious approach to QA and Game Testing. This led me to change my plans and move to Spain to try and build my career as a QA professional.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">After a while working in various jobs in Spain, while building my resume and gaining experience by testing indie games just to see my name in the credits, I landed my first full-time QA role in 2020 with a permanent contract.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">In November 2024, after four years of working as a Manual and Automation QA, I decided to leave my job to seek a new environment. I also wanted to dedicate my free time to strengthening my skills as a web developer and independent game developer. Nowadays, I feel more settled and calm, but I continue to be eager to expand my horizons and take on any challenging project that comes my way. I'm always looking to develop new skills and strengthen my knowledge in both automation testing and web/game development.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">In addition to my technical work, I sometimes dabble in drawing, and I hope to one day be able to have some time also to work on a personal comic project that I've had in mind for a while.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">I love studying languages. I speak <b>Spanish</b> as my native language, am fluent in <b>English</b> and <b>Portuguese</b>, and am currently learning <b>Japanese</b> and <b>Finnish</b>.</p>
              <p class="indented_p">I enjoy reading, still collect retro consoles and games, and, of course, whenever I can, I make sure to carve out some time to play a few rounds on a CRT!</p>
              <p class="last_p">I am currently working on <strong>„ÄåKazoku„Äç</strong>, my very first 'serious' game, to be published on the <strong><a href="https://play.date">Playdate</a></strong> console, around July/August 2025, if it all goes well.
